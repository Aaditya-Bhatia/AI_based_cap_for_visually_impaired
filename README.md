# AI based cap for visually impaired
In this project, a IoT based smart cap is equipped with a raspberry-pi, an ultrasonic sensor and a camera.
This cap helps the visually impaired in detecting and identifying objects in front of blind person. The ultrasonic detection helps the blind person by avoiding obstacles. The onboard camera uses YOLO to identify objects. 
The blind gets her feedback through audio outputs via headphones.
